A simple analytics application

The frontend is a small JS file (`panopticon.js`), that once added to a page
starts collecting analytics according to its configuration. It can filter events
by type and sends events to the backend in bulk, every N seconds.

The backend is a simple .NET Core application that uses ElasticSearch to store
analytics events and do funnels analysis. It uses `painless` (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-scripting-painless.html)
to query the ElasticSearch backend.
